# CPP

In this repository you will find all the projects I have done in C++ for Codam.

### How to use

To compile the projects you need to run the following command:

```bash
cd <project_name>
cd <ex##>
make
./<executable_name>
```

## Projects

All the projects are meant to learn something specific about C++:

- cpp00: This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!
- cpp01: This module is designed to help you understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in CPP.
- cpp02: This module is designed to help you understand Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP.
- cpp03: This module is designed to help you understand Inheritance in CPP.
- cpp04: This module is designed to help you understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP.
- cpp05: This module is designed to help you understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in CPP. 
- cpp06: This module is designed to help you understand the different casts in CPP. 
- cpp07: This module is designed to help you understand the Standard Template Library in CPP.
- cpp08: This module is designed to help you understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP.
